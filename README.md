Feedback regarding assignments:

Task #1 was simple yet interesting. The only part that took little bit more of time was assuring that upon wrong entry (e.g. char instead of int) it would ask user for the input again.

Task #2 was more challenging probably due to the recursive part and additional C# syntax that was not as present in Task #1.

Overall I enjoyed doing these tasks as they were clear, tested some of my skills, thought me some tricks and were not really time consuming.
